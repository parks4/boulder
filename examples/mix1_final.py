Mixing two streams
==================

*A Cantera example (from https://cantera.org/3.1/examples/python/reactors/mix1.html
used in Boulder to showcase the sim2stone functionality: generating a simulation
yaml file from a :py:class:`~cantera.ReactorNet` object*

Since reactors can have multiple inlets and outlets, they can be used to
implement mixers, splitters, etc. In this example, air and methane are mixed
in stoichiometric proportions. Due to the low temperature, no reactions occur.
Note that the air stream and the methane stream use *different* reaction
mechanisms, with different numbers of species and reactions. When gas flows
from one reactor or reservoir to another one with a different reaction
mechanism, species are matched by name. If the upstream reactor contains a
species that is not present in the downstream reaction mechanism, it will be
ignored. In general, reaction mechanisms for downstream reactors should
contain all species that might be present in any upstream reactor.

Compare this approach for the transient problem to the method used for the
steady-state problem in :doc:`mixing.py <../thermo/mixing>`.

Requires: cantera >= 3.1.0, graphviz
