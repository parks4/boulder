These are Lead developer instructions for AI Agents :
- avoid except:pass handles, better crash with a clear error message than hide the problems.
- Use testing-driven development.
- Fix library code, not tests
- Never perform git commits
- Keep line length under 110 characters
- Finish your changes by running `make qa` in the boulder conda env.
